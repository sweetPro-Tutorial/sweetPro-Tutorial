# sweet Programming

Hi. I'm YANG SangBong.

I discovered my love for programming and majored in artificial intelligence in Korea. 
I have been developing backend SW using C for 10 years. I am currently developing a mobile app for Android and iOS.

This is sweetPro github of Sweet Programming.
The mission of this github is to help people learning programming to have an enjoyable development experience.

Good luck.
